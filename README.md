# COVID-19 Forecasting Project

This project aims to forecast future COVID-19 cases and deaths using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. It utilizes two datasets: one containing information about confirmed cases and another containing data on deaths attributed to COVID-19. The project involves preprocessing the data, training LSTM models, and forecasting future trends.

## Project Overview

- **Author:** Thomas Puthu

## Datasets

- Two datasets are used in this project: one for confirmed cases and another for deaths.
- Due to data privacy concerns, the datasets are not provided in this repository.
- The datasets contain information on COVID-19 cases and deaths, including date-wise counts for different regions.

## Files

- `Covid-19_forecasting.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing data, training LSTM models, and forecasting future trends.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thomasputhu/covid-19-forecasting.git
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Covid-19_forecasting.ipynb` using Google Colab or any other compatible environment.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the LSTM models, and generate forecasts.
